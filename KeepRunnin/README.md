## --Gameplay--
You either run, jump or slide.
### It is highly recommended to be played with a KEYBOARD, buttons are for mobile.
**For every 10 score , the game gets harder.
The distance between obstacles are decreased as well as the movement speed is increased.**
There's an input lag when using buttons on mobile , I couldn't manage to fix that just yet.
