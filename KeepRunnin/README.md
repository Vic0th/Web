## --Gameplay--
You either run, jump or slide.
For every 10 score , the game gets harder.
The distance between obstacles are decreased as well as the movement speed is increased.
There's an input lag when using buttons on mobile , I couldn't manage to fix that just yet.

There's a scoring section below the game so you can track your progression.
